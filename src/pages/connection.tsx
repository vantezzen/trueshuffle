        Connecting your Spotify Account to TrueShuffle

      <MutedText>
        <Text b>TrueShuffle</Text> needs to connect to your Spotify account to
        get tracks in your playlist and play them using Spotify Connect. This is
        done by using the Spotify Web API.
      </MutedText>
      <MutedText>
        When first connecting your account, you will be redirected to Spotify to
        authorize TrueShuffle to access your account. During this process,
        TrueShuffle will request the following permissions:

      <ul>

          <Text b>View your Spotify account data</Text>
          <br />
          <Text i>
            Your name and username, your profile picture, how many followers you
            have on Spotify and your public playlists
          </Text>
          <Spacer />
          <MutedText>
            This permission is added automatically by Spotify. As TrueShuffle
            accesses your playlist information, this will include information
            your Spotify account. This information is only used to display the{" "}

            playlists you follow
          </Text>
          <Spacer />
          <MutedText>
            This permission is needed to provide the "Not Recently Played" mode,
            enable showing a list of Spotify Connect devices you can play on and
            to show your playlists.
